# Rotating-Fan:-

This is a Computer Graphics and Multimedia glut project for a beginner.
For completing this project I used the codeblocks (16.01 version).

Project Description:
-------------------
In this project you will learn how you could make a small project in open gl and perform multiple task on it using input from keyboard. 
This is a small project made by me just for understanding the functions working mechanism properly in glut.

Programming Language:
--------------------
C++

Instruction for Running Rhis Project:
------------------------------------
i.Click on the "s" button of the keyboard for rotating the wings of the fan.

ii.Click on the same button if you wish to stop the rotation of the fan.

iii.If you want to speed up the rotation then press and hold the "k" button.

iv. If you want to slow down the rotation then press and hold the "i" button.

More Information(s):
-------------------
If you want to understand the source machanism of this project then you have to understand some key function in it like glrectf(),glSolidTorus(),glutIdlefunc().
These are the key function that will help you to make this small project.

Future Contribution:
------------------
If you feel that any more new update will make this project more user friendly then send fork invitation on github.
